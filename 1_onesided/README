1. GOAL

The goal is to separate

    gg -> H -> ZZ -> 4mu (ggF)
    VV -> H -> ZZ -> 4mu (VBF)
    
using a one-sided cuts.

We assume a data set of 300/fb. The cross section x BR for gg is 1.5 fb, and 0.13 fb for VV.

2. SETUP

   source setup.sh  (for a bash shell)
   	  OR
   source setup.csh (for a non-bash shell)

3. TESTING

Examine a large number of one-sided cuts and save the results to a root file:

    python train.py

Then do a bit of analysis on these results

    python analyze.py
