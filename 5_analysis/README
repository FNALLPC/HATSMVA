HATS@LPC 2016	RGS Tutorial
----------------------------
1. GOAL

Perform a single-count statistical analysis of

    gg -> H -> ZZ -> 4mu (gg)
    VV -> H -> ZZ -> 4mu (VV)
    
in which the gg and ZZ contributions are considered backgrounds B1 and B2
to VV.

Assume a data set of 300/fb. The cross section x BR for gg is 1.5 fb,
and 0.13 fb for VV.

2. ANALYSIS STEPS

 1. Make trees that contain the results of task 4, namely, the MLP and BDT
 functions:

  ./maketree.py ../data/ntuple_4mu_gg.root
  ./maketree.py ../data/ntuple_4mu_VV.root
  ./maketree.py ../data/ntuple_4mu_bkg.root	  

 The samples are scaled to an integrated luminosity of 300/fb. Feel free to
 change this in maketree.py if you wish.
 
 2. Make a simulated data set from the results of the previous step
 
  ./makesimdata.py

 3. Apply your cuts to the two discriminants (see placeholder in applycuts.py)
 
  ./applycuts.py

 4. Edit dostats.py. Write the results of applycuts in the appropriate place.
 (Assume, for example, a 5-10% uncertainty in the signal and background
 estimates.) Then do
 
  ./createworkspace.py   to build statistical model and write it to
  			 HATsworkspace.root
  ./analyzeworkspace.py	 to run statistical analysis on model

 Read through these programs and try to understand what they are doing.
