--------------------
The goal is to separate

    gg -> H -> ZZ -> 4mu (ggF)
    VV -> H -> ZZ -> 4mu (VBF)

and measure the VBF cross section at 13 TeV, first using the
2.8/fb of real 4mu data, then assuming a data set of 300/fb 

The cross section x BR for ggF is 1.5 fb, and 0.13 fb for VBF.

Tutorial
--------
0_start		Look at a variety of potential discriminating variables
1_onesided	Use the random grid search (RGS) to find the best one-sided cuts
2_box		Use RGS to find the best box cut
3_ladder	Use RGS to find the best ladder cut
4_nonlinear	Use boosted decision trees and neural networks to find best cuts
5_analysis	Construct likelihood function and measure cross section
6_keras     Use modern machine learning libraries, like keras, to build a neural network
