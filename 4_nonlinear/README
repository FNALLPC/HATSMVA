----------------------------
1. GOAL

The goal is to separate

    gg -> H -> ZZ -> 4mu (ggF)
    VV -> H -> ZZ -> 4mu (VBF)
    
using boosted decision trees and neural networks (aka multi-layer perceptrons).

We assume a data set of 300/fb. The cross section x BR for gg is 1.5 fb, and 0.13 fb for VV.

2. SETUP

   source setup.sh  (for a bash shell)
   	  OR
   source setup.csh (for a non-bash shell)

3. TESTING

Construct a BDT and an MLP (aka a neural network)

    python train.py

Then do a bit of analysis on these results

    python analyze.py
